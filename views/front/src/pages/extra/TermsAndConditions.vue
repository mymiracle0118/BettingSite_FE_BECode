Some payment methods may not be available in all countries. When choosing a payment method, You agree to the terms of that payment method, You agree to any charges that apply, You agree that the payment method is valid and You agree that the payment account or card belongs to You and that You have the right to use the payment method.

We accept payments made in EUR, BRL, USD or such other currency as is made available in the currency drop down from time to time. You must choose one currency as the currency of Your Account. Any payments received in a currency other than the one chosen by you will be converted into the currency of Your Account at the exchange rate We choose. Also, any exchange premiums are payable by you. When payment is made using a credit card, We may request a certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also not visible. We do not accept cash directly or cash delivered to any payment solution provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>9.2 </b>Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is determined, or when We confirm the result of an event, any winnings will be made available to you on Your Account. If We mistakenly credit Your Account with winnings that do not belong to You for any reason, these will be taken back from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings before We become aware of this error, You must immediately inform Us and will be required to pay this back. If You do not We will take all legal action available to us to recover this debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>9.3 </b>Withdrawals You may withdraw any amount up to the “Available to Bet” balance in Your Account by issuing a valid notice of withdrawal. Notices for withdrawals must be made on the Site only. If You want to withdraw all Your funds, You must first cancel any outstanding stakes. You agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for playing the Games found on the Site. If You request a withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or more than the amount deposited, We reserve the right to enforce a turnover of the full or part of the previous deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We suspect that funds are being withdrawn for any fraudulent or money laundering reasons. Prior to accepting a withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal identification, for example certified copies of passports, ID cards or other such documentation as We feel is required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone verification, face verification or other such verification as is required to ensure that You are who You say You are. If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively exceed EUR 2,000 (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will carry out additional verification procedures. We may also carry out these verification procedures even in the case of lower withdrawals. Where a withdrawal is to be made using a credit card, We may request a certified copy of that credit card (front and back). Please ensure that only the first 6 digits and the last 4 digits of the card are visible and that the CVV /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also not visible. All withdrawals must be done through the same payment method chosen by You when placing a deposit, unless We decide otherwise or are unable to do so. If You deposit using a number of payment methods, We reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across such payment methods and process each part through the respective payment method at Our discretion and in accordance with anti-money laundering policies and regulations. The time for a withdrawal request to be finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a withdrawal attempt should be approved or denied within three (3) business days. When a withdrawal is cancelled, the funds are returned back to your account and you can make use of those funds accordingly on the account. World777.com does not assume any responsibility for any funds lost during gameplay following a withdrawal cancellation either by you or by us. All winnings of 20,000 EUR or more (excluding progressive jackpot wins), we reserve the right to divide the payout into ten installments, paid with 10 per cent of the winning sum every month until the full amount is paid out. It is at the players discretion to request a withdrawal every month until the funds are entirely paid out. We may request that You redirect Your withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected to a different method of withdrawal in accordance with anti-money laundering polices and/or regulations. Cancellation of a withdrawal (whether this was made by You or Us) does not entitle You to any compensation should You choose to play with the funds in Your Account before any withdrawal is completed. We reserve the right to charge an administrative fee in the event that You proceed with more than 30 approved withdrawals/payout requests during one (1) calendar month. The administrative fee shall be 2% of the transaction value but no less than EUR 5. It shall be charged on each withdrawal following the 30th withdrawal within each given month.

            <b>12.2 </b>Any “welcome” Bonuses are only available to new customers who open an Account on the Site and who have never held an Account on the Site before, have never received a welcome offer of any kind and who are invited to take part in a welcome offer by virtue of it being specifically offered to them when they register on the Site
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>12.3 </b>Some Bonuses must be manually activated by You in Your Account. Unless stated otherwise, You can do this after logging into Your Account and depositing the amount required to access the Bonus.

          <p>
            <b>12.4 </b>When You claim a Bonus, Your real money, the Bonus and all winnings generated from them will remain as Bonus money and may not be withdrawn or wagered on other products until wagering requirements are met.

Any attempt to withdraw any funds or cash out any placed bets prior to the complete fulfilment of the Bonus wagering requirement, may result in the Bonus and any winnings attained (including winnings that originated from Your real money used to get the Bonus) being forfeited. System bets do not count towards the wagering requirements. Only bets that have been placed and settled during the campaign period will be considered towards the wagering requirements. Any bets that are placed and settled outside this period will not count.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>12.6 </b>Any evidence or reasonable suspicion that specific bets were placed on any Game (i.e. betting in proportions on different outcomes in the same hand to create "action") without risk will not qualify for any wagering requirement. Examples of bets without risk include betting on red and black simultaneously in Roulette, and betting player and banker simultaneously in Baccarat. If You are found to be colluding with other players, for example, one person betting on the player, the other betting on the banker, You will have Your bets cancelled, Account closed and all deposits made by You may be forfeited.

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>13.2 </b> Limits You may impose limits on Your Account. These limits are:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>13.2.1 </b>Deposit Limit You may choose to limit Your maximum losses. This limit will automatically block any further deposits made if the deposit limit set has been exceeded for that selected time frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>13.2.2 </b>Session Time Limit You may choose to limit the time You spend enjoying Our Games. This pop up will appear, reminding You of the time limit You imposed on yourself and will allow you to log You out of Your Account or continue enjoying Our games. Kindly contact support to be able to set this limit. Where a session time limit falls on the hour, this pop up will be replaced by the Reality Check if you are resident outside of the United Kingdom. If You change Your mind, these limits can be changed by letting Us know via e-mail. Increasing or revoking a limit shall have effect only after seven (7) days; whereas decreasing a limit shall have effect immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>13.3 </b>Reality Check If You are resident outside of the United Kingdom and only when playing on casino Games on the Site, a pop up will appear which will pause Your Game to remind You that you have been playing for one hour. This will be done every hour. This pop up will remind You of how much You lost and how much You won. You will then select to continue to enjoy Our Games or log out. This pop up might appear later than the automatic one hour schedule if Your Game does not allow for temporary suspension. This pop up will appear immediately after Your Game ends once You have come back to Our lobby. We will not always be able to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check on the time promised. For example, if You play auto spin games, live games or games which are not hosted on Our Site We will be unable to apply the Session Time Limit or Reality Check reminders until the game has finished or You return to Our lobby. You can deactivate the Reality Check at any time by opting-out on the pop up. If You would like to reactivate this, kindly contact support or refer to the ‘My Account’ tab.

This is to prevent gambling being promoted to You in a time where You have taken some time to assess Your gambling behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>13.4.3 </b>You may also choose to “cool off” if you are a UK resident.
